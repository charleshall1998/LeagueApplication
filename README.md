## About

Based around the video game [League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/), it allows a user to easily organize and structure the various item, rune, and summoner spells systems of the game. A user can get information about the various systems and perform the standard CRUD operations on their own sets of items, runes, and summoner spell sets. 

These calls are handled via a REST API that I developed using Spring Boot and the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The front end of the application is developed with Angular.

## Purpose

To display proficiency in various technologies and full stack development including database design, REST API and back end development, and front end design and development.
